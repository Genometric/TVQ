##Repository Structure
This repository has three main branches:

- [master](https://github.com/Genometric/TVQ/tree/master);
this is the branch where the source code resides. 
- [docs](https://github.com/Genometric/TVQ/tree/docs);
this branch only contains the material used to generate
the [tvq website](https://genometric.github.io/TVQ/).
- [gh-pages](https://github.com/Genometric/TVQ/tree/gh-pages);
this branch contains the static website generated from 
the material on the [docs](https://github.com/Genometric/TVQ/tree/docs)
branch. The content of this branch is auto-generated 
once a commit is pushed to the [docs](https://github.com/Genometric/TVQ/tree/docs)
branch. 

##Basics of git

_If you are familiar with the basics of `git` you may skip this section;
if you are not, this section provides you with few steps you may take to get
started. You may also refer to [this basic git commands](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/#basic-git) 
for more details._

All the changes to the repository are made via 
[pull requests (PR)](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests);
you may take following steps to make a change and submit a PR.

1. Fork the repository by clicking on the <kbd>Fork</kbd> 
on the top-right corner on the 
[repository's github page](https://github.com/Genometric/TVQ).

2. Open your favorite shell/terminal, `cd` to the path where 
you want to [`clone`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone) the TVQ code, and run: 

    ```shell script
    $ git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/tvq.git .
    ``` 

3. [`checkout`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-checkout) the branch:

    3.a. if you want to contribute to the source code:
    
    ```shell script
    $ git checkout master
    ```  
    (`master` is the default branch, so it will checked-out by default after `clone`.)
    
    3.b. if you want to contribute to the documentation:
    
    ```shell script
    $ git checkout docs
    ``` 

4. Make the change you want, and commit them. First you may run the following to make sure 
that the changes you made are "tracked": 

    ```shell script
    $ git status
    ```
     
    if this command outputs a message like the following, that means
    the changes you made are _not_ tracked: 
     
    ```shell script
    On branch master
    Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.
     
    Untracked files:
      (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        I_am_not_tracked.txt
    
    nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
    ```
    Here the file `I_am_not_tracked.txt` is not tracked, and to track it, you may
    run the following: 
    
    ```shell script
    $ git add I_am_not_tracked.txt
    ```
    Then to commit the changes, you may run: 
    
    ```shell script
    $ git commit -m "A descriptive message for the changes you made."
    ```
    
5. The changes are now committed to git, but are stored on your machine only, 
to send them to Github, you may run the following:

    ```shell script
    $ git push
    ```

6. [Submit a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).
