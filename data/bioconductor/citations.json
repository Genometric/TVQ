To identify 3' ends, most techniques use an oligo-dT primer to construct deep sequencing libraries. However, this approach can lead to identification of artifactual polyadenylation sites due to internal priming in homopolymeric stretches of adenines. Although heuristic filters have been applied in these cases, they typically result in a high proportion of both false-positive and -negative classifications. Therefore, there is a need to develop improved algorithms to better identify mis-priming events in oligo-dT primed sequences. RESULTS: By analyzing sequence features flanking 3' ends derived from oligo-dT-based sequencing, we developed a naive Bayes classifier to classify them as true or false/internally primed. The resulting algorithm is highly accurate, outperforms previous heuristic filters and facilitates identification of novel polyadenylation sites.}, }  ",

Amplified as a complex mixture of PCR products, they can be sequenced directly on next-generation instruments without the need for cloning. This method is increasingly used to characterize, quantify and study these highly diverse receptors. Results We present here clonotypeR, a software package to identify and analyze antigen receptors from high-throughput sequence libraries. ClonotypeR is designed to process, organize and analyze very large numbers of sequences, in the order of millions, typically produced by Roche 454 or Illumina instruments, and is made of two parts. The first contains shell scripts and reference segment sequences to produce a data file where each line represents a the detection of a clonotype in a sequence read. The second part is a R module available from Bioconductor, to load and filter the data, and prepare clonotype abundance tables ready for analysis with third-party tools for differential representation analysis, sample clustering, etc. To analyze clonotype data at the nucleotide level, we introduce unique clonotype identifiers based on those developed by Yassai et al. (2009), that we corrected to avoid identifier collisions.

These nucleases also hold tremendous promise for treating a variety of genetic disorders. In the context of their therapeutic application, it is important to identify the spectrum of genomic sequences that are cleaved by a candidate nuclease when programmed with a particular guide RNA, as well as the cleavage efficiency of these sites. Powerful new experimental approaches, such as GUIDE-seq, facilitate the sensitive, unbiased genome-wide detection of nuclease cleavage sites within the genome. Flexible bioinformatics analysis tools for processing GUIDE-seq data are needed. Here, we describe an open source, open development software suite, GUIDEseq, for GUIDE-seq data analysis and annotation as a Bioconductor package in R. The GUIDEseq package provides a flexible platform with more than 60 adjustable parameters for the analysis of datasets associated with custom nuclease applications. These parameters allow data analysis to be tailored to different nuclease platforms with different length and complexity in their guide and PAM recognition sequences or their DNA cleavage position. They also enable users to customize sequence aggregation criteria, and vary peak calling thresholds that can influence the number of potential off-target sites recovered. GUIDEseq also annotates potential off-target sites that overlap with genes based on genome annotation information, as these may be the most important off-target sites for further characterization. In addition, GUIDEseq enables the comparison and visualization of off-target site overlap between different datasets for a rapid comparison of different nuclease configurations or experimental conditions. For each identified off-target, the GUIDEseq package outputs mapped GUIDE-Seq read count as well as cleavage score from a user specified off-target cleavage score prediction algorithm permitting the identification of genomic sequences with unexpected cleavage activity. The GUIDEseq package enables analysis of GUIDE-data from various nuclease platforms for any species with a defined genomic sequence. This software package has been used successfully to analyze several GUIDE-seq datasets. The software, source code and documentation are freely available at http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/GUIDEseq.html.}, }  ",

Individual miRNAs may regulate hundreds of genes, giving rise to a complex gene regulatory network in which transcripts carrying miRNA binding sites act as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs). Several methods for the analysis of ceRNA interactions exist, but these do often not adjust for statistical confounders or address the problem that more than one miRNA interacts with a target transcript. We present SPONGE, a method for the fast construction of ceRNA networks. SPONGE uses ?multiple sensitivity correlation?, a newly defined measure for which we can estimate a distribution under a null hypothesis. SPONGE can accurately quantify the contribution of multiple miRNAs to a ceRNA interaction with a probabilistic model that addresses previously neglected confounding factors and allows fast P-value calculation, thus outperforming existing approaches. We applied SPONGE to paired miRNA and gene expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas for studying global effects of miRNA-mediated cross-talk. Our results highlight already established and novel protein-coding and non-coding ceRNAs which could serve as biomarkers in cancer.}, url = {https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btz314}, eprint = {https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article-pdf/35/14/i596/28913523/btz314.pdf}, journal = {Bioinformatics}, }  ",

Access of the HPA data is mainly via web-based interface allowing view of individual proteins, which may not be optimal for data analysis of a gene set, or automatic retrieval of original images. Results: HPAanalyze is an R package for retrieving and performing exploratory data analysis from HPA. It provides functionality for importing data tables and xml files from HPA, exporting and visualizing data, as well as download all staining images of interest. The package is free, open source, and available via GitHub. Conclusions: HPAanalyze intergrates into the R workflow via the tidyverse philosophy and data structures, and can be used in combination with Bioconductor packages for easy analysis of HPA data.}, }  ",

We introduce DNABarcodeCompatibility, an R-package that allows one to design single or dual-barcoding multiplex experiments by imposing desired constraints on the barcodes (including sequencer chemistry, barcode pairwise minimal distance, and nucleotide content), while optimizing barcode frequency usage, thereby allowing one to both facilitate the demultiplexing step and spare expensive library-preparation kits. The package comes with a user-friendly interface and a web app developed in Java and Shiny, respectively, with the aim to help bridge the expertise of core facilities with the experimental needs of non-experienced users. Availability and implementation: DNABarcodeCompatibility can be easily extended to fulfil specific project needs. The source codes of the R-package and its user interfaces are publicly available along with documentation at [https://github.com/comoto-pasteur-fr] under the GPL-2 licence.
