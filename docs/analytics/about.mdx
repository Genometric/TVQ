These are scripts written in python to perform
statistical analysis on the citation data generated by
Webservice. The scripts run multiple tests asserting
different hypothesises.

To execute the tests, first setup your development
environment:

```shell
$ cd [TVQ CLONE PATH]/analytics
$ virtualenv .venv
$ source .venv/bin/activate
# on Windows:
# .\.venv\Scripts\activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

All tests are run automatically at the execution of
the following command.
```shell
python ./lib/run.py ...
```

You may type the following to see the command help:

```shell
python ./lib/run.py --help
usage: run.py [-h] {exe-all,cluster,plot-cluster,t-test,growth-hist,gain-score,pubs-in-clusters,tool-pub,citation-dist} ...

A command-line interface to the scripts implemented for analyzing the TVQ-generated citation data.

positional arguments:
  {exe-all,cluster,plot-cluster,t-test,growth-hist,gain-score,pubs-in-clusters,tool-pub,citation-dist}
                        Commands
    exe-all             Executes all the scripts in a predefined order.
    cluster             Clusters publications in repositories stored in CSV files in given input path.
    plot-cluster        Plot clusters and citation counts in quartiles.
    t-test              Performs t-test on the citation count of publications.
    growth-hist         Plots a histogram of the citation count growth.
    gain-score          Plots gain score.
    pubs-in-clusters    Plots publications in clusters.
    tool-pub            Plots tools in publications.
    citation-dist       Plots citations distribution.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
```

To see the argument for each sub command you may use the `--help` argument; for instance:

```shell
python ./lib/run.py exe-all --help
usage: run.py exe-all [-h] [-c CLUSTER_COUNT] [-s SOURCE] [-g] [-d] input

positional arguments:
  input                 Path to directory containing input data.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c CLUSTER_COUNT, --cluster_count CLUSTER_COUNT
                        Groups data in the given number of clusters. If not provided, the cluster count is determined automatically using the Elbow method.
  -s SOURCE, --source SOURCE
                        Sets the cluster source.
  -g, --plot_changes    If set, plots changes on clustered citation counts. By default the changes are not plotted.
  -d, --plot_density    If set, plots probability instead of absolute values. Default is False.
```
