A growing number of biomedical methods and protocols
are being disseminated as open-source software packages.
When put in concert with other packages, they can execute
in-depth and comprehensive computational pipelines.
Therefore, their integration with other software packages
plays a prominent role in their adoption in addition to
their availability. Accordingly, package management systems
are developed to standardize the discovery and integration
of software packages. Here we <Highlight color="#00eaff">
study the impact of package management systems on software
dissemination and their scholarly recognition.</Highlight>
We study the citation pattern of
more than 18,000 scholarly papers referenced by more than
23,000 software packages hosted by Bioconda, Bioconductor,
BioTools, and ToolShed—the package management systems
primarily used by the Bioinformatics community. Our
results suggest that there is significant evidence that
the scholarly papers’ citation count increases after their
respective software was published to package management
systems. Additionally, our results show that the impact
of different package management systems on the scholarly papers’
recognition is of the same magnitude. These results may motivate
scientists to distribute their software via package management
systems, facilitating the composition of computational
pipelines and helping reduce redundancy in package development.
