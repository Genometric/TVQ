The objective of this project is to assess if adding a software to
package management system (PMS) can significantly impact its adoption.
To assess adoption, we use citation count as a quantifying metric.

For this study, we need the following information:

- Metadata of all the tools hosted by a PMS;
the least required metadata are:
   - Tool name;
   - Reference to the tool's scholarly paper;
   - Date when the tool was published to the PMS.

- Citation per year for a every scholarly paper. We get this
information from Scopus.

Therefore, we first obtain tool metadata from PMS, then we
search on Scopus for their citation information, then we perform
statistical analysis to assert if the data rejects the
hypothesis or not (adding software to PMS can significantly
increase their citation count). Accordingly, the TVQ project
consists of multiple components each performing a unique
task in collecting or studying data. The components are:

- [**Offline crawlers**](../offline_crawlers/about)â€”_you do not need to run them_;
they collect some information about tools that are resource-expensive. These
crawlers are run by the maintainers of this project, and their output is
cached on github to be used by the Webservice.
- [**Webservice**](../webservice/about); this service collects
tool metadata and search Scopus for citation information. It
also generates descriptive statistics about the tools and their
citation count, and exports data to be used as input for
the analytical scripts.
- [**Analytics scripts**](../analytics/about); these are python scripts that
take data generated by Webservice, perform statistical analysis, and
report their results in tables and plots.

The following figure is an abstract illustration of the components.
