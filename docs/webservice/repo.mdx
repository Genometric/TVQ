## List Defined Repositories

You can get a list of defined repositories by sending
a GET request as the following:

```
curl -X GET http://localhost:3030/api/v1/Repositories/
```

The API endpoint will return a JSON object containing
the defined repositories. For instance, the following
are the list of the default repositories:

```json
[
    {
        "ID": 1,
        "Name": "ToolShed",
        "URI": "https://github.com/Genometric/TVQ/raw/master/data/toolshed/",

## Tools in Repositories

TVQ implements _crawlers_ to collect information
about repositories. In order to invoke a crawler,
send a POST request as the following:

```
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/RepoCrawlingJobs \
     -d "{Repository:{\"ID\":4}}"
```

This is a request to collect information about Bioconductor, and
TVQ will respond with the respective crawling job it created:

```json
{
    "ID": 5,
    "RepositoryID": 3,
    "Status": "Queued",
    "UpdatedDate": "Wednesday, 10 March 2021 20:35:23",
    "CreatedDate": "Wednesday, 10 March 2021 20:35:23",
    "Repository": {
        "ID": 3,
        "Name": "Bioconductor",
        "URI": "https://github.com/Genometric/TVQ/raw/master/data/bioconductor/",
        "UpdatedDate": "Sunday, 28 February 2021 16:18:19",
        "CreatedDate": "Sunday, 28 February 2021 16:18:19"
    }
}
```

The `Status` of the job can be either of the following:
`{Queued, Running, Completed, Failed}`.

To check the status of a cralwer, you may send
a GET request as the following:

```
curl -X GET http://localhost:3030/api/v1/RepoCrawlingJobs/
```

which will respond with a JSON object containing all the
submitted repository crawling jobs as the following:

```json
[
    {
        "ID": 1,
        "RepositoryID": 1,
        "Status": "Completed",
        "UpdatedDate": "Sunday, 28 February 2021 20:43:55",
        "CreatedDate": "Sunday, 28 February 2021 16:19:06",
        "Repository": {
            "ID": 1,
            "Name": "ToolShed",
            "URI": "https://github.com/Genometric/TVQ/raw/master/data/toolshed/",
            "UpdatedDate": "Sunday, 28 February 2021 16:18:19",
            "CreatedDate": "Sunday, 28 February 2021 16:18:19"
        }
    }
]
```
